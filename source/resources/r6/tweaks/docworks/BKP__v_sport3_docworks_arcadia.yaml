# NX: Shy, this is the *Arcadia* ... setting this value makes it read as a bog-standard Turbo-R 610, like, one of the fucken 4-bangers.
# SV: Changing that string breaks the external camera rendering system you like to use for glamour shots.
# NX: Wait, is THAT WHY??? I've been trying to fix that issue for like six months!! Wtffffffff ... but ... changing the manufacturer name *doesn't* break them?
# SV: Nope. Quadra does rebrand in some countries overseas, after all.

      # NX: When me and the Na'vowae first built the OG Mark I, we had to gut a wrecked Coyote for its suspension, so the original shocks and springs were from a Coyote, and Reya Makure (the mechanic who designed the "Makure" 990R) was the one who put the data in the computer. To this day, I haven't been able to change the name without the entire system crashing ...
      # SV: So why's the controller data referencing a Type 66 Javelina now?
      # NX: I FIXED IT!
      # NX: ... EXCEPT NOT QUITE!! I was TRYING to give it a more wide-spectrum AWD handling profile, but then the AugLEV kept dropping the rear to be level with the front. GRRRR.
      # SV: Which didn't work because the whole thing's still physically designed around the tilt from a Shion. Right. Lemme take a look...

# SV: Moved Erok's gearbox data to its own little partition of the CCU. Doesn't change much, just makes it a little easier to eyeball.
# SV: These are all *close* to the setup Erok originally made, and no disrespect intended, but I think these are a little more in line with where the 'chargers peak out and you'd shift gears anyway.
